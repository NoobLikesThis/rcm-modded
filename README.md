# rcm
rcm, aka Roblox Cache Modifier is a python script to change any file that roblox caches (animations, textures, meshes and more)
these changes can not be detected by roblox (as of writing this)


## How to run
1.  Clone the repo
2.  double click the .py

## Usage
1. Click on cache or preset you want to replace
2. click Apply
3. Restart roblox / leave and rejoin game


## Upcoming features
*  More functions will be added soon
*  More Presets and preinstalled caches will be added soon
*  Added functionality for caches that are not animations (should work already but want to improve)
